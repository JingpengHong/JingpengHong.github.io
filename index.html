Welcome to my website!
<br><br>
<strong> Education </strong><br>
  
My name is Jingpeng and I am a Master student in Economics at the University of Chicago. 
<br>
In July 2021, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Economics from the National School of Development, Peking University.
<br><br>
My research interests lie in quantitative marketing, empirical IO, causal inference, especially in retailing and healthcare. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://JingpengHong.github.io/research" target="_self">research</a> to learn more!
<br><br>
I will start my PhD (Business Administration, Quant Marketing track) at Harvard Business School in August, 2022.
