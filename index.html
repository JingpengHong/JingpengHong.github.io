<p style="text-align:justify;"> Welcome! I am a doctoral student in Quantitative Marketing at Harvard Business School. I will graduate with a Master's in Management Research in May 2025, and am actively seeking job opportunities in data science and machine learning.
<br><br>
My research combines machine learning, deep learning, and statistical econometric methods to help firms optimize and automate their business decisions, with the focus on digital marketing, advertising, recommender systems and online experimentation. I am proficient in Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, CausalML, scikit-learn), R, SQL, MATLAB, and Stata.  
<br><br>
I was born and raised in Dalian, China. I received a BA in Economics from Peking University and an MA in Economics from the University of Chicago.
