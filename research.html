<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b> This paper examines the impact of China's public long-term care insurance (LTCI) pilots on the well-being of older adults and their families. Using panel data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, we exploit the rollout of the LTCI pilots across different cities during 2015–2017 and identify the effect of LTCI using a difference-in-differences approach. We find that the implementation of LTCI has reduced the likelihood of insured older adults reporting unmet activity of daily living (ADL)–related need for care, the intensity of informal care, and the amounts of ADL-related care expenditures and out-of-pocket medical expenditures. LTCI coverage was also associated with an improvement in self-reported health and a reduction in one-year mortality risk of the insured older adults. From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that the introduction of LTCI may benefit all members of the household, both care recipient and caregivers, which has important implications for the development of LTCI in China and other middle-income and developing countries.

<strong>The "Reshuffle Effect" during COVID-19: Social Distancing and Market Concentration</strong>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b> This paper presents some of the evidence on the effect of social distancing compliance on grocery stores/supermarkets footfall traffic. The paper uses granular visit data from cell-phone tracking to estimate the shift in visits to different sizes of grocery stores/supermarkets as COVID-19 spread in the US. The empirical work provides three useful insights. First, a higher level of social distancing will cause a lower level of market concentration among stores, with a larger effect in the high population density market. Second, both large and small grocery stores/supermarkets suffered drops after pandemic outbreak, with large stores suffering a significantly larger decline. Last, we find social distancing compliance will make customers spend more time in stores and travel for less distance to shop. The findings can be documented as a "Reshuffle Effect" of market share during the COVID-19 pandemic.
