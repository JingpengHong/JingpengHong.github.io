<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b> This paper examines the impact of China's public long-term care insurance (LTCI) pilots on the well-being of older adults and their families. Using panel data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, we exploit the rollout of the LTCI pilots across different cities during 2015–2017 and identify the effect of LTCI using a difference-in-differences approach. We find that the implementation of LTCI has reduced the likelihood of insured older adults reporting unmet activity of daily living (ADL)–related need for care, the intensity of informal care, and the amounts of ADL-related care expenditures and out-of-pocket medical expenditures. LTCI coverage was also associated with an improvement in self-reported health and a reduction in one-year mortality risk of the insured older adults. From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that the introduction of LTCI may benefit all members of the household, both care recipient and caregivers, which has important implications for the development of LTCI in China and other middle-income and developing countries.

<strong>The "Reshuffle" Effect during COVID-19: Social Distancing and Market Concentration</strong>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b> This paper presents some of the evidence on the effect of social distancing compliance on grocery stores/supermarkets footfall traffic. The paper uses granular visit data from cell-phone tracking to estimate the causal effect of voluntary social distancing behavior during COVID-19 pandemic on the localized market concentration level. The baseline strategy is to exploit the census tract level variation in social distancing compliance based on the stay-at-home rate, together with the time variation of the pandemic outbreak.The empirical work provides three useful insights. First, the foot traffic shows a clear shift by consumers away from more crowded stores toward less busy stores due to the fear of infection, leading to a lower localized market concentration level among stores. This reallocation pattern can be documented as a "Reshuffle" effect of market share during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, the COVID-19 has larger "Reshuffle" effect for markets (census tracts) with higher population density and more competitors. Third, the main reasons for the "Reshuffle" effect include a shift to stores closer to home, reduced shopping frequency, and turning to big brands for trust. In other words, small businesses are achieving a larger share of a smaller pie during the COVID-19 outbreak.
